		<p>	Please dont contact us, but if you must, the A&M Karate School is not a real karate school, but rather a 
			sample project for programming students at Carnegie Mellon University. We 
			are sure that you wanted treatment for your children from the most exquisite 
			dojo masters on the planet, but that's how it goes sometimes.  If you are 
			bitterly disappointed (and quite honestly, you should be) and want to 
			grouse to someone, here's the contact info:</p>
